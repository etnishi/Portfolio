# Side Scroller Prototype

This is my latest prototype as of May 2022 of a Side Scroller project.

This version contains improved versions of previous features such as a new movement system, aimable projectiles, 
enemies that can detect players, water / swimming, upgrades/ collectables, NPC dialogue, and fullscreen mode.

The collision detection in this version is now pixle perfect to each object's hitbox.

This version features save and load game functions that save a javascript file in %APPDATA%/SS_Prototype_V3.5.

# RPG Prototype

This is a prototype JRPG style game made in Game Maker.

This is my second serious attempt at a JRPG style game utilizing skills and 
techniques gained by making 'Tom and Twig'. However, this version is still early and unfinished.

The main intent of this version is to make a more easily scallable version of the ideas 
in 'Tom and Twig'
